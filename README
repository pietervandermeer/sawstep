Sawstep - a step sequencer for the sawbench synthesizer, for Atari ST

System Requirements:

Atari ST, or compatible, 640x400x2 resolution. Falcon/TT compatible. 512k RAM
should be enough.

Description:

A step sequencer that can also control the sawbench' midi-only features. The 
sequence is just 16 notes in a row that can be sped up and down and edited with
the Atari's keyboard. 

Controls:

escape     : exit 
space      : play/stop
<-         : go left one step
->         : go right one step
num +      : increase tempo
num -      : decrease tempo
,          : lower velocity
.          : increase velocity
up arrow   : increase key
down arror : decrease key
0          : set velocity to zero
l          : toggle legato
[          : toggle vca envelope looping
]          : toggle vcf envelope looping
g          : glide time up (slower)
G          : glide time down (faster)
f          : fm modulation depth down
F          : FM modulation depth up
t          : vcf keyboard tracking down
T          : vcf keyboard tracking up

Future updates:
- multiple patterns
- load/save
- bpm indication
- multi-channel (for controlling a beatbox in parallel)
